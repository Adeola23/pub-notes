>God is with those who persevere.

>Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius. — [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](https://amzn.to/3ABPtDk) by Peter Thiel.

>Dogged determination is often the only trait that separates a moderately creative person from a highly creative one. That's because great work is never done by temperamental geniuses, but by obstinate donkey-men.

>Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.

>We are what we repeatedly do. Our character is a composite of our habits. Habits constantly, daily, express who we really are.

>We have to work equally hard to replace the old patterns of self-defeating behaviors. An old Latin proverb tells us how: a nail is driven out by a nail, habit is overcome by habit.

>Fear is a demon that devours the soul of a company: it diminishes the quality of our imagination, it dulls our appetite for adventure, it sucks away our youth. Fear leads to self-doubt, which is the worst enemy of creativity.

>Trust is one of the greatest economic forces on earth. —  [The NEW Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charlie Munger](https://amzn.to/3Gx5sFn).

> How great we become depends on the size of our dreams. Let's dream humongous dreams, put on our overalls, go out there and build them.

>If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word my bet would be on “curiosity” — [How To Do Great Work](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)by Paul Graham.

> Only dead fish go with the flow.

>Focus is a prerequisite for great work. 
This is because most hard problems are soluble in deep effort, but insoluble in shallow attempts

>I don’t need validation through association.

>In the long-term, finding the optimal path is a bigger priority, but when starting out, focus on getting your reps in.

>When starting out, optimization is paralyzing because it’s an expensive algorithm to run.
Optimizing requires running comparisons and weighing features to arrive at a decisive conclusion

>Once I realized that many of my [decisions are reversible](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/), I lost my fear of diving into things

>Explore, then exploit.

>Make reversible decisions as soon as possible and make irreversible decisions as late as possible

>When something feels strange, it’s usually a signal that there are holes in my understanding, maybe worth investigating.

>Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.

>We had picked the right project. It was big enough to be useful, small enough to be possible. Start with a small piece; fulfill one goal at a time, on time. Do it with all things in life. You can’t jump to the end game right away, in computers, politics, love or any other aspect of life - Bloomberg

>Reduce friction or enable digitisation

>It baffles me that people think making really, really brilliant, stupendous, worldshocking pieces of work is a particular challenge. It's mainly a battle of endurance. The longer you try and deshit something, the less shit it is. This is called "revision", and it is one hundred percent effective, and people still don't do it.
