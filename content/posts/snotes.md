>Focus is a prerequisite for great work. 
This is because most hard problems are soluble in deep effort, but insoluble in shallow attempts

>I don’t need validation through association.

>In the long-term, finding the optimal path is a bigger priority, but when starting out, focus on getting your reps in.

>When starting out, optimization is paralyzing because it’s an expensive algorithm to run.
Optimizing requires running comparisons and weighing features to arrive at a decisive conclusion

>Once I realized that many of my [decisions are reversible](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/), I lost my fear of diving into things

>Explore, then exploit.

>Make reversible decisions as soon as possible and make irreversible decisions as late as possible

>When something feels strange, it’s usually a signal that there are holes in my understanding, maybe worth investigating.

>Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.
