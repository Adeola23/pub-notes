>Focus is a prerequisite for great work. 
This is because most hard problems are soluble in deep effort, but insoluble in shallow attempts

>I don’t need validation through association.

>In the long-term, finding the optimal path is a bigger priority, but when starting out, focus on getting your reps in.

>When starting out, optimization is paralyzing because it’s an expensive algorithm to run.
Optimizing requires running comparisons and weighing features to arrive at a decisive conclusion

>Once I realized that many of my [decisions are reversible](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/), I lost my fear of diving into things

>Explore, then exploit.

>Make reversible decisions as soon as possible and make irreversible decisions as late as possible

>When something feels strange, it’s usually a signal that there are holes in my understanding, maybe worth investigating.

>Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.

>We had picked the right project. It was big enough to be useful, small enough to be possible. Start with a small piece; fulfill one goal at a time, on time. Do it with all things in life. You can’t jump to the end game right away, in computers, politics, love or any other aspect of life - Bloomberg

>Reduce friction or enable digitisation

>It baffles me that people think making really, really brilliant, stupendous, worldshocking pieces of work is a particular challenge. It's mainly a battle of endurance. The longer you try and deshit something, the less shit it is. This is called "revision", and it is one hundred percent effective, and people still don't do it.
